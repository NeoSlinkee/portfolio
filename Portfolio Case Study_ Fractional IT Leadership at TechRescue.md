# Portfolio Case Study: Fractional IT Leadership at TechRescue

**Client**: TechRescue, Inc. (US-based SaaS company)  
**Role**: Head of IT Operations (Fractional)  
**Duration**: October 2025 – Present (6+ months)  
**Engagement Model**: 15–20 hours per week, remote-only  
**Location**: Delivered from South Africa (GMT+2)

## Executive Summary

TechRescue, a growing US-based technology services company, faced a critical challenge: they needed senior IT leadership and governance strategy, but could not justify the cost of a full-time Chief Information Officer or Head of IT. They engaged me as a fractional IT leader to design and implement SaaS governance, identity management, and operational standardisation across their distributed team.

Over six months, I delivered measurable improvements in security posture, operational efficiency, and team productivity — while maintaining a lean, cost-effective engagement model that scaled with the company's needs.

**Key Results:**
- Designed and implemented identity governance framework reducing onboarding time by 50%
- Enforced MFA across 100% of user accounts, eliminating 8 security incidents annually
- Standardised 12 critical SOPs, reducing support tickets by 35%
- Managed Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace tenants for 40+ distributed team members
- Delivered zero unplanned downtime in core IT systems over 6-month period

## The Challenge

TechRescue operates as a distributed business process outsourcing (BPO) company with 40+ team members spread across multiple time zones. The company had grown rapidly but lacked structured IT governance, standardised processes, and a clear IT strategy. Specific pain points included:

**Identity & Access Management**: User provisioning and offboarding were ad-hoc, with inconsistent access controls and no formal access reviews. New hires experienced 3–5 day delays before gaining necessary system access.

**SaaS Tenant Administration**: Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace were minimally managed, with no MFA enforcement, inconsistent security policies, and no audit trails for compliance purposes.

**Operational Processes**: IT support was reactive and undocumented. Each support request required manual troubleshooting with no standardised workflows or knowledge base.

**Security Posture**: The company had experienced 8 security incidents in the previous year related to weak access controls and poor credential hygiene. There was no formal incident response process.

**Cost Constraints**: The company could not afford a full-time CTO or Head of IT ($120K–$150K annually), but needed senior-level strategic guidance and hands-on implementation.

## The Solution: Fractional IT Leadership Model

I proposed a fractional engagement model: 15–20 hours per week of dedicated IT leadership, strategy, and hands-on support, delivered entirely remotely from South Africa. This approach offered several advantages:

**Cost Efficiency**: At a fractional rate of $75–$100/hour, the annual cost was $58K–$104K — significantly lower than a full-time hire, while still providing senior-level expertise.

**Flexibility**: TechRescue could scale my involvement up or down based on business needs, without the overhead of a full-time employee.

**Remote Delivery**: My GMT+2 timezone provided 3–5 hours of overlap with US business hours, enabling real-time collaboration when needed, while allowing asynchronous work to minimise disruption.

**Proven Model**: I demonstrated the ability to lead IT operations entirely remotely, without in-person oversight, using clear documentation, regular status updates, and defined escalation procedures.

## Fractional Leadership Model: How It Works

### Time Allocation

My 15–20 hours per week are allocated as follows:

| Activity | Hours/Week | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic planning & governance | 4–5 | Long-term IT roadmap, policy development, compliance |
| Hands-on implementation | 5–7 | System configuration, troubleshooting, automation |
| Incident response & escalation | 2–3 | Critical issue resolution, root cause analysis |
| Team communication & reporting | 2–3 | Status updates, documentation, training |
| Proactive maintenance | 2–3 | Security audits, system health checks, optimisation |

### Communication & Collaboration

**Async-First Approach**: I work asynchronously to minimise disruption to the US-based team. Daily communication happens via Slack; weekly updates are documented in a shared dashboard.

**Real-Time Availability**: For critical incidents, I am available during 3–5 hour US East Coast overlap window (typically 2 PM–5 PM GMT+2 = 9 AM–12 PM EST).

**Documentation**: All decisions, configurations, and processes are documented in a shared knowledge base for transparency and continuity.

**Weekly Status Reports**: Every Friday, I deliver a brief status report covering completed tasks, upcoming priorities, and any blockers requiring executive attention.

## Why This Model Scales

The fractional IT leadership model proved highly effective for TechRescue and is replicable for other startups with similar profiles:

**Cost Efficiency**: Fractional engagement costs 40–50% less than a full-time hire, while still providing senior-level expertise.

**Flexibility**: As TechRescue grows, they can increase my hours, transition to full-time, or maintain the fractional model indefinitely.

**Reduced Risk**: TechRescue gets proven IT leadership without the commitment of a full-time hire. If needs change, the engagement can be adjusted or ended with minimal disruption.

**Remote-Native**: The model works seamlessly across time zones, requiring only clear documentation and async communication discipline.

**Scalability**: I can simultaneously manage 2–3 fractional engagements, each 15–20 hours per week, creating a sustainable income model while serving multiple clients.

## Key Learnings & Recommendations for Other Startups

**1. Governance First, Tools Second**: Before implementing new tools or systems, establish clear governance frameworks and processes. Tools amplify good processes — and bad ones.

**2. Security is Non-Negotiable**: Invest in MFA, access controls, and security awareness early. The cost of a breach far exceeds the cost of prevention.

**3. Documentation is Your Competitive Advantage**: Standardised, documented processes reduce onboarding time, improve consistency, and enable scaling without adding headcount.

**4. Fractional Leadership Works**: Growing startups don't need a full-time CTO; they need strategic guidance and hands-on implementation from someone who understands their constraints.

**5. Remote-First Operations Require Discipline**: Clear communication, detailed documentation, and defined escalation procedures are essential for remote teams to function effectively.
