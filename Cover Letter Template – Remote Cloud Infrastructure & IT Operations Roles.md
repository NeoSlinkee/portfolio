Dear [Hiring Manager Name / Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cloud Operations Engineer position at [Company Name]. With over 15 years of hands-on experience stabilising production AWS environments, managing identity and access governance, and leading remote operations teams, I am confident I can deliver immediate value to your infrastructure team.

**Why I'm a strong fit for your team:**

Your job description emphasises the need for someone who can manage AWS EC2 workloads, enforce IAM governance, and respond to production incidents with minimal escalation. These are precisely the areas where I have delivered consistent results. Most recently, as Head of IT Operations for TechRescue (a US-based SaaS company), I have successfully managed cloud infrastructure and identity governance entirely remotely — demonstrating the async communication and timezone-aware problem-solving your distributed team requires.

**Specific strengths I bring:**

I have hands-on expertise in the exact tech stack you're using: AWS EC2, IAM, Route 53, and S3. I've designed and implemented least-privilege access controls across multiple AWS environments, conducted security audits, and led incident response efforts that reduced mean-time-to-resolution by 40%. My background in SaaS identity governance (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, RBAC) means I understand the operational complexity of managing access across multiple platforms — a skill that translates directly to your infrastructure needs.

Beyond technical capability, I bring a proven track record of working remotely with US-based teams from South Africa. My GMT+2 timezone provides 3–5 hours of overlap with US East Coast business hours, and I have demonstrated the discipline to communicate asynchronously, document decisions clearly, and escalate issues appropriately without requiring real-time supervision.

**Why [Company Name] matters to me:**

I am drawn to [Company Name] because of your commitment to [mention specific company value, product, or engineering practice from their website]. I am particularly interested in contributing to [specific team or project mentioned in the job description], and I believe my experience in [relevant skill] positions me to make an immediate impact.

I am actively seeking a remote-first role where I can apply my AWS and SaaS operations expertise to help scale infrastructure for a growing team. I am available to start immediately and am open to flexible working arrangements that suit your team's needs.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in remote cloud operations can support [Company Name]'s infrastructure goals. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

## Template 2: Fractional IT Director / Head of IT Role

**Use this for**: Fractional IT Director, Head of IT Operations (part-time), or Fractional CTO positions at startups.

[Founder / Hiring Manager Name]
[Company Name]

Dear [Founder Name / Hiring Team],

I am writing to introduce myself as a potential Fractional Head of IT / IT Director for [Company Name]. With over 15 years of infrastructure and operations experience, plus proven success leading IT operations remotely for a US-based SaaS company, I am well-positioned to help you scale your IT function without the overhead of a full-time hire.

**The fractional IT leadership model:**

I understand that as a growing startup, you need senior IT leadership and strategic guidance — but you may not yet need (or want) a full-time CTO or Head of IT. I offer a proven fractional model: 15–20 hours per week of dedicated IT leadership, strategy, and hands-on support, scaled to your needs as you grow. I currently serve TechRescue in this capacity, and I am actively seeking 2–3 additional fractional engagements to build a sustainable, diversified income model.

**What I bring to your team:**

**Infrastructure & Cloud Strategy**: I design and manage AWS environments, enforce security controls, and optimise cloud costs. I can audit your current infrastructure, identify risks, and create a roadmap for scaling.

**Identity & Access Governance**: I implement Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace tenant administration, RBAC, MFA enforcement, and access lifecycle management — critical for startups managing distributed teams.

**Operational Excellence**: I develop SOPs, standardise onboarding/offboarding workflows, and build processes that reduce operational friction and improve team efficiency.

**Incident Response & Reliability**: I act as the escalation point for critical technical issues, diagnose root causes, and implement preventative measures to reduce downtime.

**Remote-First Operations**: I have led IT operations entirely remotely for a US-based company from South Africa, demonstrating the async communication, timezone awareness, and self-directed problem-solving that distributed teams require.

**Why this model works for startups:**

You get senior IT leadership and strategic guidance without the salary, benefits, and overhead of a full-time hire. I am available on-demand for critical issues and work asynchronously to minimise disruption to your team. As you grow, I can scale my involvement or transition to a full-time role if needed.

**My availability:**

I am currently available for 2–3 concurrent fractional engagements (15–20 hours per week each). My GMT+2 timezone provides good overlap with US business hours, and I have proven experience managing multiple clients simultaneously while maintaining high-quality deliverables.

I would welcome a brief call to discuss your IT challenges and how a fractional IT leadership model could support your growth. I am confident that my experience and approach align with your needs.

[Project Lead / Hiring Manager Name]
[Company Name]

Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

I am interested in the AWS Cloud Consulting / Infrastructure Audit project at [Company Name]. With extensive hands-on experience designing, securing, and optimising AWS environments, I am well-positioned to deliver the [specific project goal] you are seeking.

**Project-specific expertise:**

Your RFP mentions the need for [specific requirement, e.g., "AWS IAM security audit", "EC2 cost optimisation", "infrastructure migration planning"]. I have successfully completed similar engagements:

- **AWS IAM Security Audit**: Reviewed access controls across 50+ AWS accounts, identified 30+ high-risk permissions, and implemented least-privilege remediation — reducing security exposure by 85%.
- **EC2 Workload Optimisation**: Analysed instance utilisation, rightsized underutilised instances, and implemented auto-scaling policies — reducing monthly AWS spend by 35%.
- **Infrastructure Migration Planning**: Designed and executed migration of on-premises workloads to AWS, minimising downtime and ensuring compliance with security requirements.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

I combine hands-on AWS technical expertise with the ability to communicate findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders. I work independently, meet deadlines consistently, and deliver actionable recommendations that drive measurable business outcomes.

**Remote delivery model:**

I deliver all consulting work remotely, with clear documentation, regular status updates, and defined deliverables. My GMT+2 timezone allows flexibility to accommodate your team's schedule, and I am comfortable working asynchronously to minimise disruption.

**Next steps:**

I am available to discuss the project scope, timeline, and deliverables at your convenience. I am confident I can deliver the results you are seeking within your budget and timeline.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss your current M365/Google Workspace challenges and how a retainer engagement could support your organisation.

3. **Quantify your impact** — Replace generic statements with specific metrics (e.g., "reduced mean-time-to-resolution by 40%", "managed 50+ AWS accounts").
4. **Show timezone awareness** — Mention your GMT+2 advantage and how it benefits their team (especially for US/EU companies).
