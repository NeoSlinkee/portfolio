# LinkedIn Profile Analysis – Christopher Maarschalkerweerd

## Current Positioning
- **Headline**: "Cloud & Systems Engineer | AWS Certified | Infrastructure & Production Support"
- **Location**: City of Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa
- **Top Skills**: Cloud Infrastructure, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Office 365 Administration

## Key Strengths Observed
1. **Comprehensive experience history** — 15+ years across multiple roles, well-documented
2. **Strong technical depth** — AWS, M365, Active Directory, networking, virtualization
3. **Clear progression** — from junior IT support to fractional IT leadership
4. **Certifications highlighted** — AWS Solutions Architect Associate & Cloud Practitioner

## Gaps & Opportunities for Remote Positioning

### 1. **Headline Not Remote-Optimised**
- Current: "Cloud & Systems Engineer | AWS Certified | Infrastructure & Production Support"
- **Issue**: Doesn't signal remote capability, fractional leadership, or international experience
- **Recommendation**: Change to "Cloud Infrastructure & IT Operations Engineer | AWS Certified | Remote-First | Fractional IT Leadership"

### 2. **Missing Remote/Fractional Keywords**
- LinkedIn profile doesn't explicitly mention:
  - Remote-first experience
  - Fractional/part-time leadership
  - US-based client work (TechRescue)
  - Timezone advantage (GMT+2)
  - Async communication skills

### 3. **Summary Needs Remote Emphasis**
- Current summary is strong but generic
- **Missing**: explicit mention of remote work success, fractional model, timezone advantage
- **Recommendation**: Add opening line: "Proven remote-first Cloud Infrastructure Engineer delivering fractional IT leadership to US-based SaaS companies..."

### 4. **TechRescue Role Positioning**
- Listed as "Head of IT Operations (Fractional)" — **good**
- But could emphasize:
  - Remote-only delivery model
  - Timezone management success
  - SaaS governance expertise
  - Replicable fractional model

### 5. **Missing Endorsements/Skills for Remote Roles**
- Add: "Remote Work", "Fractional Leadership", "Async Communication", "SaaS Operations"
- These are high-value keywords for remote job boards

### 6. **No Mention of Freelance Platforms**
- LinkedIn doesn't indicate active presence on:
  - Upwork
  - Contra
  - Toptal
  - Freelancer
- **Recommendation**: Add to "Open to Work" section or About section

## Alignment with Tailored CV
- **CV emphasises**: Remote credibility, fractional model, timezone advantage, ATS keywords
- **LinkedIn currently**: Strong on technical depth but weak on remote/fractional positioning
- **Action**: Update headline, summary, and add remote-specific skills to align with CV

## Recommended LinkedIn Updates (Priority Order)

1. **Headline** (High Impact)
   - Change to: "Cloud Infrastructure & IT Operations Engineer | AWS Certified | Remote-First | Fractional IT Leadership"

2. **About Section Opening** (High Impact)
   - Add: "Proven remote-first Cloud Infrastructure Engineer delivering fractional IT leadership to US-based SaaS companies. Currently Head of IT Operations at TechRescue (US-based). GMT+2 timezone with 3–5hr US East Coast overlap."

3. **Skills Section** (Medium Impact)
   - Add: Remote Work, Fractional Leadership, Async Communication, SaaS Operations, Cloud Operations

4. **Open to Work** (Medium Impact)
   - Set to: "Remote roles only"
   - Roles: Cloud Operations Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Fractional IT Director, AWS Cloud Consultant

5. **TechRescue Role Description** (Medium Impact)
   - Emphasize: "Remote-only fractional IT leadership", "Timezone-managed", "SaaS governance"

## Summary
LinkedIn profile is **technically strong but not optimised for remote positioning**. The tailored CV positions you better for remote roles. Recommend updating LinkedIn to mirror the CV's remote-first messaging to create consistency across all platforms.
