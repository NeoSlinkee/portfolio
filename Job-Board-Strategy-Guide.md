# Job Board Strategy Guide – Remote Cloud Infrastructure & IT Operations Roles
## Christopher Maarschalkerweerd

---

## Overview

The remote job market is fragmented across multiple specialised platforms, each with distinct audiences, application processes, and success rates. Rather than applying broadly to every job board, this guide recommends a **targeted, platform-specific strategy** that maximises your visibility to the right employers while minimising wasted effort.

This guide covers 12 job boards and freelance platforms, organised by engagement type (full-time remote, fractional/part-time, project-based consulting, and retainer work). For each platform, you'll find specific strategies, application tips, and expected timelines.

## Application Best Practices

### 1. Customise Every Application

Never use a generic cover letter or proposal. Spend 5–10 minutes customising each application to the specific role and company.

**For full-time roles:**
- Reference specific company details (product, recent news, engineering blog)
- Mention 2–3 specific job requirements
- Highlight relevant experience from your CV

**For fractional/project-based roles:**
- Reference the client's specific needs
- Highlight relevant case studies or past projects
- Propose a clear scope and timeline

### 2. Apply Within 24 Hours

Most job boards favour applications submitted within 24 hours of posting. Set up job alerts and check daily.

### 3. Highlight Your Timezone Advantage

For US/EU companies, explicitly mention your GMT+2 timezone and the overlap hours. This is a major advantage for remote roles.

### 4. Use Your Portfolio

Link to your TechRescue case study in every application. This demonstrates your ability to deliver results.

### 5. Respond Quickly to Inbound Inquiries

For platforms like Contra, Toptal, and Lemon.io, respond to inbound inquiries within 24 hours. Quick response rates improve your algorithm ranking.

### 6. Build Social Proof

On platforms like Upwork and Toptal, your first project is critical. Accept a slightly lower rate for your first project to build reviews and social proof.

## Expected Timeline to First Income

| Income Stream | Time to First Income | Effort Required |
|---|---|---|
| Full-time remote role | 1–3 months | 3–4 hrs/week |
| Fractional IT director (1st client) | 2–6 weeks | 2–3 hrs/week |
| Project-based consulting (1st project) | 1–2 weeks | 2–3 hrs/week |
| Retainer work (1st client) | 2–4 weeks | 1–2 hrs/week |

---

## Red Flags & How to Avoid Them

**Red Flag 1: Extremely Low Rates**
If a client offers significantly below market rate ($30–$50/hour for cloud infrastructure work), it's often a sign of either inexperience or an attempt to underpay. Politely decline and move on.

**Red Flag 2: Vague Project Scope**
If a client can't clearly define what they need, the project will likely be chaotic. Ask clarifying questions and get written scope before committing.

**Red Flag 3: No Contract or Payment Protection**
Always use the platform's built-in contract and payment protection. Never work outside the platform for your first few projects.

**Red Flag 4: Excessive Revision Requests**
If a client requests unlimited revisions or scope creep, set clear boundaries in your contract and charge for additional work.

---

## Next Steps

1. **This week**: Create profiles on We Work Remotely, Remote.co, Wellfound, Contra, and Upwork (prioritise these 5)
2. **Week 2**: Create profiles on Toptal, Lemon.io, and GoFractional
3. **Week 3+**: Begin applying to 8–12 roles/projects per week across all platforms
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain profiles, respond to inbound inquiries, and track applications

---

## Tracking Your Applications

Create a simple spreadsheet to track your applications:

| Date | Platform | Role/Project | Company | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-24 | We Work Remotely | Cloud Ops Engineer | TechCorp | Applied | Customised cover letter |
| 2026-02-24 | Upwork | AWS Audit Project | StartupXYZ | Bid submitted | $3K project, 2-week timeline |
| 2026-02-25 | Contra | Fractional CTO | GrowthCo | Inquiry received | Awaiting response |

This will help you track your success rate and identify which platforms are generating the most opportunities.

---

## Final Thoughts

The remote job market is competitive, but your combination of AWS expertise, fractional IT leadership experience, and remote-first delivery model positions you well. The key is to be **systematic, persistent, and strategic** in your approach.

Focus on quality over quantity: a well-customised application to a well-matched role is worth 10 generic applications. Apply consistently, track your results, and adjust your strategy based on what's working.

Good luck with your job search!
