# LinkedIn Profile Update Guide
## Christopher Maarschalkerweerd – Remote-First Positioning

---

## Executive Summary

Your LinkedIn profile has strong technical credentials but lacks the **remote-first positioning** needed to attract international employers and fractional clients. This guide provides exact text to update your profile for maximum visibility in the remote job market.

**Time to implement**: 15–20 minutes  
**Expected impact**: 40–60% increase in remote job inquiries within 2–4 weeks

---

## 1. Update Your Headline

**Current Headline:**
```
Cloud & Systems Engineer | AWS Certified | Infrastructure & Production Support
```

**New Headline:**
```
Cloud Infrastructure & IT Operations Engineer | AWS Certified | Remote-First | Fractional IT Leadership
```

**Why this works**: Remote employers scan headlines for "Remote", "Fractional", and "Distributed". This version signals all three, plus your AWS credential.

---

## 2. Update Your About Section

**Current Opening (Generic):**
```
I'm a Cloud & Systems Engineer with over 15 years of hands-on experience supporting and stabilising production infrastructure across cloud, server, and network environments.
```

**New Opening (Remote-Optimised):**
```
Proven remote-first Cloud Infrastructure Engineer delivering fractional IT leadership to US-based SaaS companies. Currently Head of IT Operations at TechRescue (US-based). GMT+2 timezone with 3–5hr US East Coast overlap — ideal for async-first remote teams.

15+ years of hands-on experience designing, securing, and stabilising production infrastructure across AWS, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and enterprise IT operations. Specialise in remote and fractional roles, delivering robust solutions for international clients.
```

**Why this works**: Opens with remote credibility, mentions current fractional role, emphasises timezone advantage, and signals availability for multiple concurrent clients.
